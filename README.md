`wasm-opt` is a component of the [Binaryen] toolkit
that optimizes [WebAssembly] modules. It is written
in C++.

[Binaryen]: https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen
[WebAssembly]: https://webassembly.org/

This project provides a Rust crate that builds `wasm-opt` and:

1) makes its command-line interface installable via `cargo install`,
2) provides an API to access it programmatically.

**This project is in development and not ready for use.**




## Installing the binary

```
cargo install wasm-opt --locked
```

It should behave exactly the same as `wasm-opt` installed from other sources.




## Using the library

See the [API documentation][api].

[api]: https://docs.rs/wasm-opt




## Toolcahin requirements

Requires Rust 1.48+ and a C++ compiler with C++17 support.
It does not require CMake or other C++ build tools.

These are the earliest C++ compiler versions known to work:

- gcc - TODO
- clang - TODO
- msvc - TODO




## Building from source

```
git clone https://github.com/brson/wasm-opt-rs
cd wasm-opt-rs
git submodule update --init --recursive
cargo build && cargo test
```
